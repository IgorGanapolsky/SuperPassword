# GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Setup

## Current Status

As of September 9, 2025, the Copilot coding agent is **DISABLED** for this repository.

## Why You Need This

The Copilot coding agent enables:

- Automated PR creation from issues
- Branch creation and code generation
- Automated issue-to-code workflows
- AI-powered development assistance

## How to Enable (Repository Admin Required)

Since you're the repository admin, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Repository Settings

1. Go to https://github.com/IgorGanapolsky/SuperPassword/settings
2. Navigate to **"Code & automation"** → **"Copilot"**
3. Find **"Copilot coding agent"** section

### Step 2: Enable the Agent

1. Toggle **"Enable Copilot coding agent"** to ON
2. Configure permissions:
   - ✅ Allow branch creation
   - ✅ Allow PR creation
   - ✅ Allow pushing to branches
   - ✅ Allow issue assignment

### Step 3: Configure PR Behavior

In the same Copilot settings:

1. Set **"Copilot Code Review"** preferences:
   - Enable automatic review on PRs
   - Set review scope (all files or changed files only)
   - Configure suggestion types

### Step 4: Test the Integration

Once enabled, test by:

1. Creating an issue with clear requirements
2. Using "@copilot" mention in the issue
3. Asking Copilot to implement the feature
4. Copilot should create a branch and open a PR

## Alternative: Organization-Level Settings

If you have a GitHub organization:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Navigate to **"Copilot"** → **"Policies"**
3. Enable for all repositories or specific ones

## Verification

After enabling, you should see:

- Copilot badge on PRs it creates
- "@github-copilot" as a collaborator in insights
- Copilot suggestions in PR reviews

## Troubleshooting

If Copilot coding agent is still disabled:

- Check if you have an active Copilot subscription
- Ensure your repository is not in a restricted organization
- Verify you have admin permissions
- Check if enterprise policies override repository settings

## Current Limitations

- Copilot settings cannot be configured via GitHub API
- Must be enabled through the GitHub web interface
- Requires active Copilot subscription (Individual, Business, or Enterprise)
