## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and other improvements. Before creating a new issue, please check if a similar issue already exists.

When creating an issue, please follow these guidelines:

1. Use a clear and descriptive title
2. Provide a detailed description of the issue
3. Include steps to reproduce (for bugs)
4. Specify your environment (OS, browser, etc.)
5. Include screenshots or animated GIFs if possible

Our automated issue management system will:
- Automatically triage new issues
- Apply appropriate labels based on content
- Monitor SLA compliance
- Move issues through the project board

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Ensure your PR addresses an open issue
2. Follow the pull request template
3. Include tests if applicable
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Keep PRs focused on a single change

## Issue Management

We have an automated issue management system that helps us track and prioritize issues. The system automatically:

- Labels new issues for triage
- Updates issue status based on assignments
- Monitors SLA compliance
- Moves issues through the project board

For more information about how the system works, see our [Issue Management Documentation](ISSUE_MANAGEMENT.md).

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Follow the existing code style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Use Jest for testing
